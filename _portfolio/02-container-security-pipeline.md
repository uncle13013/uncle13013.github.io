## Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive container security pipeline that integrates vulnerability scanning, policy enforcement, and runtime protection into existing CI/CD workflows. This solution addresses the critical need for secure container deployment in cloud-native environments.

## Challenge

The organization faced several container security challenges:
- **Vulnerable Base Images**: Containers built with outdated base images containing known vulnerabilities
- **Secrets in Images**: Hardcoded secrets and sensitive data in container images
- **Runtime Security**: Lack of runtime monitoring and threat detection for running containers
- **Policy Enforcement**: Inconsistent security policies across different environments

## Solution Architecture

### Pipeline Components

1. **Image Scanning Stage**
   - Multi-layer vulnerability scanning
   - Secret detection and prevention
   - License compliance checking
   - Custom policy enforcement

2. **Registry Security**
   - Harbor enterprise registry with role-based access
   - Image signing and verification
   - Automated vulnerability database updates
   - Quarantine policies for high-risk images

3. **Runtime Protection**
   - Falco-based runtime security monitoring
   - Network policy enforcement
   - Resource limit validation
   - Behavioral anomaly detection

4. **Compliance Dashboard**
   - Real-time security posture visualization
   - Compliance reporting and metrics
   - Alert management and escalation
   - Historical trend analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Security Scanning Pipeline

```yaml
# Jenkins Pipeline Example
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.build("app:${env.BUILD_ID}")
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Security Scan') {
            parallel {
                stage('Vulnerability Scan') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL app:${BUILD_ID}'
                    }
                }
                stage('Secret Detection') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'trufflehog filesystem --json .'
                    }
                }
                stage('Policy Check') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'conftest verify --policy security-policies/ Dockerfile'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Registry Push') {
            when {
                expression { currentBuild.result != 'FAILURE' }
            }
            steps {
                script {
                    docker.withRegistry('https://harbor.company.com', 'harbor-creds') {
                        docker.image("app:${env.BUILD_ID}").push()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Technologies

**Scanning Tools:**
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanner
- **Clair**: Static analysis of vulnerabilities
- **TruffleHog**: Secret detection in source code and images
- **Conftest**: Policy enforcement using Open Policy Agent

**Container Registry:**
- **Harbor**: Enterprise-grade container registry
- **Notary**: Content trust and image signing
- **Image Replication**: Multi-region registry synchronization

**Runtime Security:**
- **Falco**: Runtime security monitoring
- **OPA Gatekeeper**: Kubernetes admission controller
- **Network Policies**: Pod-to-pod communication control
- **Pod Security Standards**: Kubernetes security context enforcement

## Security Policies

### Dockerfile Security Standards

```dockerfile
# Enforced security best practices
FROM node:16-alpine AS base
# Non-root user creation
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Security scanning checkpoints
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Multi-stage build for minimal attack surface
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production

# Copy with proper ownership
COPY --from=base --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app ./
USER nextjs

# Health check implementation
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

### Kubernetes Security Policies

```yaml
# Pod Security Policy Example
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: restricted-psp
spec:
  privileged: false
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
    - ALL
  volumes:
    - 'configMap'
    - 'emptyDir'

package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
    input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
    input.request.object.spec.containers[_].securityContext.privileged == true
    msg := "Privileged containers are not allowed"
}

deny[msg] {
    input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
    input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
    not starts_with(input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image, "harbor.company.com/")
    msg := "Images must be pulled from approved registry"
}
```

### Runtime Monitoring Rules

```yaml
# Falco Rules for Runtime Detection
- rule: Suspicious File Access
  desc: Detect access to sensitive files
  condition: >
    open_read and
    fd.name in (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/hosts) and
    not proc.name in (cat, grep, less, more)
  output: >
    Sensitive file accessed (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline 
    file=%fd.name container=%container.name)
  priority: WARNING
```
