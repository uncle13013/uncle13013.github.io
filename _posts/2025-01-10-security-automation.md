One thing I've learned is that you don't need to automate everything at once to see benefits from security automation. Small, focused improvements can make a big difference.

## Start Small

I started with simple scripts to:
- Check for common misconfigurations
- Generate basic security reports
- Automate routine security tasks

These small automations saved time and reduced human error, which gave me confidence to tackle bigger challenges.

## Focus on Repetitive Tasks

The best automation targets are usually:
- Tasks you do regularly (daily, weekly scans)
- Tasks that are error-prone when done manually
- Tasks that need to be done consistently across environments

## Learn as You Go

Every automation project teaches you something new about your environment and security needs. I've found it's better to start with simple tools and gradually build complexity than to try to implement a perfect solution from day one.

What security tasks have you automated? I'm always looking for new ideas and approaches.
