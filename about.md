## Philosophy & Approach

> "Security is not a product, but a process. It's not something you buy, it's something you do."

I believe in:
- **Security by Design**: Building security into systems from the ground up

- **Continuous Learning**: The security landscape evolves rapidly, and so must we
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Great security comes from great teams working together
