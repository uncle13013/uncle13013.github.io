A 6-node Kubernetes cluster running across two physical machines using Infrastructure as Code principles. Key highlights:

- **Multi-machine setup**: High-availability cluster distributed across HP Omen laptop and Toshiba Satellite using Vagrant + VirtualBox
- **Production-ready networking**: Bridged networking with static IPs, enabling direct LAN access to all cluster nodes  
- **Automation-first approach**: Ansible playbooks for configuration management on Flatcar Linux (container-optimized OS)

Built to demonstrate enterprise-grade virtualization and gain hands-on experience for Kubernetes certifications.


### AI in Developer Workflows
Using tools like GitHub Copilot to better understand how developers leverage AI in real-world coding and automation scenarios.

### Red Team & OSCP Prep
Working through TryHackMe exercises to gain hands-on red team experience as I work toward a long-term goal of taking the OSCP exam.
