# Projects

A few things Iâ€™m currently exploring and building:

- **AI in Developer Workflows:** Using tools like GitHub Copilot to better understand how developers leverage AI in real-world coding and automation.
- **Kubernetes Home Lab:** Building and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster at home on repurposed hardware to refresh and sharpen my skills while studying for the KCA/KCS exams.
- **Red Team & OSCP Prep:** Working through TryHackMe exercises to gain hands-on red team experience as I work toward a long-term goal of taking the OSCP exam.
